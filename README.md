### Supplement

My supplement answers are located in the "Supplement" folder inside this repo. Click the file entitled "SUPPLEMENT.md"

### Images of the site

To see images/video of the site in action, click on this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1o_iVpiXDocETW_yLv-0vQ5i1OcC8IzfX?usp=sharing) to enter the google drive folder containing images/video of the site.

### How to use the website

Due to limited time, I was not able to deploy this react project to a web provider like Heroku. If requested, I would be able to complete this step and update this readme to the link of the website.

To run this website locally, clone the repository to your desktop. Open a terminal/powershell window and navigate to the directory (Node + npm must be installed).

Run the command `npm install` to install all dependencies. Then run `npm run dev` to launch the website.

On a browser, enter `localhost:5173` in the browser to see the site
